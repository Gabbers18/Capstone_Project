## Newsgroup Topic Modeling
This project involves creating a topic model using a random sample of newsgroup data that can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selva86/datasets/master/newsgroups.json) or within this repository. The goal is to extract meaningful themes from a subset of posts by applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

Objectives:
- Load and explore a JSON dataset of newsgroup posts.
- Create a random sample (40%) of the dataset for analysis.
- Generate descriptive statistics about the number of posts and their distribution across newsgroups.
- Preprocess the text (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.) to prepare for topic modeling.
- Build and refine a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to identify key topics.
- Interpret the topic model results and explain what insights they provide.
