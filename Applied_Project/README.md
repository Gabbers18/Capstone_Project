## Applied Project (Fall 2023-Spring 2025)

This study utilizes MEA in conjuction with CRQA to conduct continuous data anlaysis on experimental data.

This study seeks to uncover the reasoning behind how people coordinate movements and language through a common task. 
Examining multiple channels simultaneously requires a more “data-driven” approach (Yu et al., 2010). This approach utilizes 
technologies that capture fine-grained multimodal data recorded in real-time, as well as data mining techniques that extract 
meaningful patterns. In the case of this study, we seek to examine the emergence of initiator/responder roles through movement
recurrences utilizing Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA). Analyses, such as CRQA, are useful in uncovering hidden 
patterns between multiple people that may have been overlooked by human observers. We also utilize Ramseyer's Motion Energy Analysis (MEA)
techniques to extract motion energies of each individual in the task. The goal of these analyses is to identify anomalies or patterns that 
may be important to know for training purposes or within other contexts (Angus et al., 2012).
